# Hello-World
This is a tutorial repository to learn how to use Git-Hub

I am supposed to write a bit about myself according to the tutorial.  I'm A.J Berger, and I like programming.  I'm using GitHub to look at open source projects, study them, and make commits whenever I feel I am knowledgable to do so.  Hopefully I stay commited enough to put these things on a resume at some point.  As of today, 5/24/2017, I know C++ and am learning Python.  I'll check back in a year and see how much I've grown as a programmer.
